    "\n",
    "We aim to train an agent to collect an object in a room. The room specifications are decided by the user (room dimensions and locations of inner walls). The agent is initially placed at a fixed or random starting location in the room. At each time step, the agent takes one of four actions (move north, east, south or west). Every time the agent bumps into a wall, it receives a negative reward of $-1$. When the agent finds the goal object, it receives a positive reward of $10$ and the game terminates. After 100 steps, if the agent has not reached the goal yet, the game terminates.   "
